# Road-Intersection-Management
A simulation of multiple types of road intersections, such as roundabouts, railroad intersections, pedestrian crosswalks, semaphores, priority intersections. The simulation uses threads as cars, humans, trains. The objects are moving according to traffic laws and physical context (the first car to arrive at the semaphore is the first to leave).
